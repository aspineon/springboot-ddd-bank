In this project I am trying to apply principles of Domain Driven Design.
In contrary to full-blown DDD examples on the web I am applying here some simplifications.
This sample application is used for a course on Software Engineering at Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin.

This project uses

- JDK 8
- Maven 3
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data + JPA + Hibernate + Derby
- AspectJ Compile Time Weaving for main sources
- `springfox-swagger` for generating documentation and user interface for the REST service
- JUnit 4
- The Exception Handling and Reporting Framework MulTEx
